"""The verdict about a page, decided once for both engines.

Both engines scanned the same four lists from `detection.py` in the same order
and reached the same verdict, in code written twice. The lists were shared; the
rule that reads them was not, which is the shape that lets two engines drift
while looking like they agree.

Like `assembly.py`, and for the same reason (one engine is synchronous and the
other asynchronous), the rule is a generator: it says what to look at and in
what order, and each engine supplies only how to look. Short-circuiting matters
here and is preserved: the stealth engine re-runs this every poll while a
challenge is up, and each selector costs a round trip to the browser.

The one difference between the engines is a parameter rather than a fork.
`turnstile_is_a_challenge` is false for the Chrome engine, which can only reach
a checkbox through a tab count the caller supplies as `tabs_till_verify`, so
treating a bare widget as a challenge would send it into a wait loop it cannot
win and cost the whole budget. The stealth engine clicks by coordinate and needs
no such help. That is a capability boundary, pinned by
`test_engine_conformance.DetectionConformanceTest`.
